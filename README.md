Forked from [wbxml.codeplex.com](http://wbxml.codeplex.com)

The [WBXML specification](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/affiliates/wap/wap-192-wbxml-20010725-a.pdf) is developed by the [Open Mobile Appliance](http://www.openmobilealliance.org).

WBXML is for example used for data synchronization between mobile device and server based on the [SyncML specification](http://www.syncml.org),
which is also developed by the Open Mobile Alliance.

WBXML makes use of token pages for encoding and decoding from and to plain XML.
